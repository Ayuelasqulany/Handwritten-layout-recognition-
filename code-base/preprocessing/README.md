The main objective is to
identify the interest points in the image which further helps in feature extraction.
Pre-processing performs operations with images at the lowest level of abstraction
where both input and output are intensity images. The goal of pre-processing is to
improve the image data by removing annoying distortions and enhance image
features significant for further processing. Our preprocessing sequence as
following: Gaussian filter, GrayScale, Binarization, Horizontal lines removal, Normalization and Data Augmentation
