 ## Model Architecture
 
 Once the Dataset is prepared, the next step is to design and train a machine-learning model using TensorFlow and CTC loss.
1. We define the input and output layers: The input layer of the model should be a 4D tensor with dimensions [batch size, width, height, channels], where the batch size is the number of images in a batch, width, and height are the dimensions of the images, and channels are the number of color channels in the images (1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB).

2. Add the CNN layers: The CNN layers of the model should be responsible for extracting features from the images. A typical architecture for the CNN layers is to use a combination of convolutional, pooling, and fully-connected (dense) layers.

3. Add the RNN layers: The RNN layers of the model should be responsible for processing the sequence of features and predicting the characters in the text. A common type of RNN to use for this task is a long short-term memory (LSTM) network.

4. Finally, we compile the model: Once the CNN and RNN layers have been defined, the model can be compiled using the CTC loss function and an optimizer such as Adam
